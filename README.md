# What are you?

I am an __overly simple__ library to make it a bit easier to build simple SQL statements for [node-postgres](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/) (affectionaly known as `pg`). I generate the `{ text: '...', values: [] }` objects that you typically pass to `client.query(...)`.

It gets tedious matching up `$1, $2` etc. and building the right kind of values array. My functions help you do this and get the place-holder numbers right, even for `UPDATE/SET/WHERE` and for `WHERE IN` clauses and Postgres `ARRAY[]` values which require a flattened array of arguments.

I have some tests written in Mocha. Of course I could use more!

_No really_. __Overly simple__. 

# Like what?

```
var SQL = require('bloom-sql'),
    INSERT = SQL.INSERT,
    SELECT = SQL.SELECT,
    UPDATE = SQL.UPDATE,
    DELETE = SQL.DELETE;
```

Selecting stuff:

```
> SELECT().FROM('foo').WHERE({ a: [1,2,3], b: 4 });
{ text: 'SELECT * FROM foo WHERE a IN ($1, $2, $3) AND b = $4',
  values: [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ] }
```

Deleting stuff:

```
> DELETE('foo').WHERE({ a: 1, b: 2 });
{ text: 'DELETE FROM foo WHERE a = $1 AND b = $2',
  values: [ 1, 2 ] }
```

Inserting stuff:

```
> INSERT('foo').VALUES({ a: null, b: null, c: null });
{ text: 'INSERT INTO foo(a, b, c) VALUES($1, $2, $3)',
  values: [ null, null, null ] }
```

Updating stuff:

```
> UPDATE('foo').SET({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }).WHERE({ d: 4, e: 5 }).RETURNING('*');
{ text: 'UPDATE foo SET a = $1, b = $2, c = $3 WHERE d = $4 AND e = $5 RETURNING *',
  values: [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ] }
```

__This code does not talk to the database.__ Connect to `pg` as normal as pass one of the resulting query objects to the db to run it:

```
var pg = require('pg'),
    SELECT = require('bloom-sql').SELECT;

var db = new pg.Client('YOUR_DB_URL');
db.connect();

var query = SELECT('*').FROM('users').WHERE({id:1}).LIMIT(1);
db.query(query, function(err,results){
  // ensure !err
  // check results.rowCount === 1 
  // do stuff with results.rows[0]
});
```

# TODO

 * complex conjunctions `(a = 1 AND b = 2) OR (c = 3 AND d = 4)`
 * comparisons in where clauses `(a > 1 AND b < 2)`
 * any hint of `JOIN`, sub-select, etc.
 * the other 90% of SQL?
 * it would be nice to support Postgres `ARRAY` operators in `WHERE` clauses, but this probably requires a different way of doing `IN` queries. Right now:
   * in `UPDATE` and `INSERT`, a JS Array `[1,2,3]` will be converted into a Postgres `ARRAY[$1,$2,$3]` and the values flattened appropriately for the prepared statement
   * in `WHERE` clauses, a JS Array `[1,2,3]` will be converted into a SQL `IN ($1,$2,$3)` and  the values flattened appropriately for the prepared statement

# Installation

`npm install bloom-sql --save`

(`--save` automatically updates your `package.json` file, tell your friends)
